
 <h1>Malaria Prediction Model</h1>

   <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project is a derivative work based on an existing malaria prediction model. I have enhanced its functionality and accuracy by incorporating additional features and improvements.</p>

   <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Efficient techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for training and testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Advanced methods to extract meaningful features from the raw data, improving the model's predictive power.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to train the model.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Comprehensive evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> Added functionalities and optimizations to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness of the model.</li>
    </ul>
